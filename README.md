# lineinradio
lineinradio is a 24/7 online radio station which plays sets uploaded by users. 
Sets can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours and span all genres. 
Although sets can be any energy level, slower sets will be played in the mornings and more fast paced music in the evenings.
This is paired with a simple user interface.

# Technical Details
The project is written in Python 3 and utilizes the Django framework. 
All templating and database management is handled by Django.
Task scheduling is handled by django_q.
Downloading from external services uses the ytdlp library.
The project is split into 3 different apps:

## website
The frontend is written in lightweight HTML, CSS, and minimal Javascript.

Its main features are:
- User registration, sign up, and session management
- Show and Episode creator
- Profile customization

## scheduler
The scheduler runs tasks throughout to make sure all episodes are ready to be played. It also generates a new schedule every night.

Its main functions are:
- Orders sets based on what time they will play (slower in the morning, faster in the evening)
- Downloads all episodes that are going to be played in the next bloc
- Plans around important sets that need to be played at certain times

## radio
The radio app is a compact WebSocket server that streams chunks of audio to everyone listening in.

Its main functions are:
- Maps the time to the bytes in an audio file 
- Stream chunk of data to the client
- Utilize MediaSource to buffer audio so radio plays without interruptions

# How to run
### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or above
- [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) and [mpc](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpc)
- Python dependencies: django, Pillow, ytdlp, daphne, channels, django-q2.

On Debian/Ubuntu you can run the following command to install all dependencies: ```apt install python3 python3-django python3-pil yt-dlp python3-daphne python3-django-channels python3-django-q mpd mpc```

Or install via pip: ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Setup the environment
Run the script ```setup.sh```. This will initialize the database and register all scheduled tasks.

### Run the server
Run these commands at the same time (in the project directory): 
```
python manage.py runserver
python manage.py qcluster
mpd --no-daemon radio/mpd.conf 
```
The first command starts the Django frontend, the second runs tasks periodically like downloading episodes and generating schedules, and the third runs mpd and stores the current queue.

You will need to serve the media and static directory under the ```/media/``` and ```/static``` endpoints respectively when Django is running in production.
This is usually done with nginx or another web server.
